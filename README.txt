This is a sample project students can use during Matthew's Git class.
* git@github.com:matthewmccullough/hellogitworld.git
* git:/



/github.com/matthewmccullough/hellogitworld.git
* https://matthewmccullough@github.com/matthewmccullough/hellogitworld.git

We can, as an example effort, even modify this README and change it as if it were source code for the purposes of the class.

This demo also includes an image with changes on a branch for examination of image diff on GitHub.
